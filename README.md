[![build](https://github.com/osm-nz/RapiD/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/osm-nz/RapiD/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%22)

This is fork of RapiD for the [LINZ Address import & LINZ data import](https://github.com/osm-nz/linz-address-import) project. See that repository for details.

Do _not_ commit changes to the `/dist` folder. Instead, the CI will automatically build and deploy the latest version of the `linz-addr-mainline` branch.

To update this fork to include the latest changes from RapiD and iD, go [here](https://github.com/osm-nz/RapiD/compare/linz-addr-mainline...facebookincubator:main) and click <kbd>Create pull request</kbd>
